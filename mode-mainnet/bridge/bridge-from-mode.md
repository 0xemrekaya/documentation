# â¬… Bridge from Mode

Mode's bridge is a fork of Optimism's canonical bridge. With Optimism's Bedrock upgrade, a two-step withdrawal process designed to enhance the safety and integrity of cross-chain transactions was introduced.

{% hint style="info" %}
We understand that the 7 days finalisation period may be inconvenient but this is a decision made by Optimism to give higher security to the bridge. Security is our number one priority.\
\
Third party bridges will be available soon to improve withdrawal times.
{% endhint %}

## The three steps to withdraw:
